Fixture types are now exported so the may be used in pytest plugin hooks.

  The newly-exported types are:

  - ``pytest.FixtureDef`` for :class:`FixtureDef <pytest.FixtureDef>`
  - ``pytest.SubRequest`` for ``_pytest.fixtures.SubRequest``  (derived from :class:`FixtureRequest <pytest.FixtureRequest`).


  They are used by ``pytest_fixture_setup`` and ``pytest_fixture_post_finalizer`` hook definitions.
